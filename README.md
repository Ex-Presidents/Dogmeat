# Dogmeat
An open-source discord bot on the discord.net 1.0 api

**What is Dogmeat?**

Dogmeat is your new best friend. No longer is his company limited to the Wasteland.
On a literal note, Dogmeat is an open-source discord bot using the discord.net 1.0 api.
It's currently being actively developed and improved. However, it is in a closed alpha(unavailable to the public.)

---

**What can I expect from Dogmeat?**

At this point in time, dogmeat's functions are limited. If Scooty and ic3 decide to pitch in dogmeat may become public.
Right now, hoever, you can expect the following:
* Basic moderation commands including ban, mute
* Offensive remarks and responses sparing no minority
* Transparency - all source except for the token is included in the repository.

**Please Note**

The source is personalized. If you use him as a base for your own, you are encouraged to sort through the source and cleanse it of the many things you will not need.

**FAQ:**

**Q**: Why are there tokens in the history?

**A**: These are expired tokens existing due to my stupidity.

**Q**: If the source is public, why is dogmeat private? When will dogmeat become public?

**A**: Dogmeat is private because it's in an experimental phase on an unstable host. It will become public when we decide it meets our standards and we have the necessary funds to host the bot.
