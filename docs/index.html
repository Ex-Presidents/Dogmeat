            <h3>What is Dogmeat?</h3>
            <p>Dogmeat is your new best friend. No longer shall you need to go through a vigorously complex gui. Instead, your faithful Dogmeat takes commands.</p>
            <p>On a literal note, Dogmeat is a WIP discord bot that is currently unavailable to the public. You may use the source to compile and modify your own bot, but Dogmeat himself will not answer to you.</p>

            <h3>What can I expect from Dogmeat?</h3>
            <p>As of right now, Dogmeat is not capable of much. Thankfully, his master is working on changing this. Regardless, you can expect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic administrative/moderation commands including /ban and /mute</li>
                <li>Offensive responses sparing no minority</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If Scooty ever feels like contributing you may be able to expect more. Thanks anyway! :D</p>

            <h3>What is the point of this website?</h3>
            <p>I'm glad you asked. I thought you might be curious since Dogmeat is in a closed alpha (unavailable to the public.) At this point in time, I plan to use the website as an archive for the changelogs.</p>

            <h3>Why are there tokens in the source?</h3>
            <p>Again, I'm glad you asked! These are expired tokens that you are only seeing due to my stupidity.</p>
