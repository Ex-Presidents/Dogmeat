**What is Dogmeat?**

Dogmeat is your new best friend. No longer is his company limited to the Wasteland.
On a literal note, Dogmeat is an open-source discord bot using the discord.net 1.0 api.
It's currently being actively developed and improved. However, it is in a closed alpha(unavailable to the public.)

**What can I expect from Dogmeat?**

At this point in time, dogmeat's functions are limited. If Scooty and ic3 decide to pitch in dogmeat may become public.
Right now, however, you can expect the following:
* Basic moderation commands including ban, mute
* Offensive remarks and responses sparing no minority
* Transparency - all source except for the token is included in the repository.
