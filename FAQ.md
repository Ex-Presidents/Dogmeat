**FAQ:**

**Q**: Why are there tokens in the history?

**A**: These are expired tokens existing due to my stupidity.

**Q**: If the source is public, why is dogmeat private? When will dogmeat become public?

**A**: Dogmeat is private because it's in an experimental phase on an unstable host. It will become public when we decide it meets our standards and we have the necessary funds to host the bot.
